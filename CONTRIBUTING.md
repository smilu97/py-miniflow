Actually this project was started for educating of machine learning beginners (like me)

So I will write some documents about full source codes of this repository in "tutorial" folder, you may get information of
basic structure of this project.

(IMPORTANT) I'm just a student majoring CS in Korea, so all of the sentences in English in this repository may be quite weird,
and sometimes very rude or casual. Please excuse me when you see some weird English sentences, and I'll very appreciate
if you notice them to me.
